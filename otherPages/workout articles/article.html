												Beginner's Workout Program</a></h2>
											</header>

											<h3>READY TO GET FIT?</h3>
											<p>In the realm of fitness, three-month workout programs dominate the landscape. You’ve even seen plenty of them in our magazine over the years. Are they effective? Absolutely. But we’re going to let you in on an interesting secret: It doesn’t necessarily take 8 or 12 weeks to get your feet wet in the gym. Not that you’ll be a seasoned vet after four weeks, but if you can just get that first month under your belt, you’ll get yourself over the proverbial hump, where so many fail and give up, and set the stage for a lifetime of muscle gains.</p>

												<p>Let’s just call this the accelerated beginner’s guide to bodybuilding. In this plan, your first month of training will be demanding, but not so demanding as to cause injury (or worse yet, burnout), and progressive in the sense that each week you’ll graduate to different exercises, higher volume, more intensity or all of the above. After four weeks you’ll not only be ready for the next challenge but you’ll have built a significant amount of quality muscle. In other words, one month from now you’ll look significantly better with your shirt off than you look now. (How’s that for results?)</p>
												
												<p>This program isn’t just for the true beginner who has never touched a weight before; it’s also suitable for anyone who has taken an extended leave of absence from training. How long has it been since you went to the gym regularly? Six months? A year? Five years? No worries: The following routines will get you back on track in—you guessed it—just four short weeks. Let’s get to work.</p>
											<h3>BEGINNER"S WORKOUT AT A GLANCE</h3>
											<p><strong>Week 1:</strong> Full-body split<br>
												<strong>Week 2:</strong> Two-day split: Upper body/Lower body<br>
												<strong>Week 3:</strong> Three-day split: Push/Pull/Legs<br>
												<strong>Week 4:</strong>Four-day split: Full body</p>

															<p><strong>The Importance of staying active</strong><br>When you’re stuck at home, traveling with work, on vacation, or quarantining, it isn’t always easy to stick to an exercise routine or maintain your fitness goals. You may only have limited access to fitness facilities or find it difficult to adjust to a new routine. Perhaps you miss the camaraderie of your gym, the familiarity of swimming laps in your local pool, or the social connection from walking or hiking with your usual group of workout buddies. If you’re used to attending a fitness class with a motivating instructor, you might also be disappointed in the intensity of workouts on your own.</p>

															<a href="images/pic11.jpg" class="image left"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></a>
															<p>Think a single type of exercise will take care of all your needs? These tips can help you build a comprehensive fitness plan to improve your health and waistline.<br><br>
																<strong>What are the best exercises for me?</strong><br>
																For many of us, even when we understand how much regular exercise can improve our mental and physical health, the real challenge lies in developing an exercise routine that we can stick with. It’s much easier to get up and get moving every day when you actually experience the results you’re looking for—whether that’s trimming your waistline, improving your sleep, mood, and energy, or easing symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression</p>
