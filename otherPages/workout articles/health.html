															<p>Coffee is one of those things that no one can seem to agree on. Much like eggs or red meat, studies go back and forth on whether it’s healthy or will lead to certain death before you can say “one cold brew, please.” Alright, that may be a bit dramatic, but you know what we mean.

																But if your fitness goal happens to be lower body fat, coffee just may help you reach it, according to a recent study published in The Journal of Nutrition.</p>

															<p>Even if you’ve never given your immune system a thought in the past, we’re willing to bet it’s been on your mind during the coronavirus pandemic. Between implementing social distancing measures and working around business closures, it’s impossible not to think about COVID-19 at the moment.</p>
															<p>
																It’s key to follow guidelines set by the experts, whether that means wearing a mask at stores or staying six feet away from others in public. But when things to start to open up again and restrictions are lifted, it can’t hurt to do everything you can to keep your immune system healthy.</p>
															<p>
																Staying fit and eating whole foods—along with getting sleep and regularly washing your hands—are some of the best ways to keep the sniffles and sneezing away. But when a hectic schedule starts wearing you down, a little immune system boost may be in order.</p>

													<br>Adding the right foods to your diet can make you feel happier and more energized. Here's what to eat.

											<h3>By Linda Stephens</h3>
											<p>Although Hippocrates once said, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food,” it was once thought that food had no affect on the brain or feelings of well-being. But caffeine, alcohol, carbohydrates, and fats all directly effect how you feel.

												There’s a reason that soups and stews in the winter months make us feel content, or eating watermelon on a hot summer’s day can make us feel refreshed. All these foods release certain brain chemicals that elicit feelings of happiness and excitement.
												
												Here are some of those foods that release “happy” brain chemicals. Incorporate these foods into your day to boost your mood and feel more energized.</p>

												<p><strong>Asparagus</strong> <br>
													These long, green stalks are excellent plant-based sources of tryptophan, which increases serotonin levels.
													
													Serotonin regulates brain functions such as mood, appetite, sleep, and memory. Low levels of serotonin can cause anxiety, depression, or moodiness. So, if you’re feeling “not like yourself,” grill, steam, or sauté some asparagus into your next meal.</p>
												
												<p><strong>Fruits And Vegetables</strong><br>
													Both are loaded with B vitamins, which are responsible for mood and increased energy levels.
													
													There are a wide variety of B vitamins in produce: B2 is found in spinach and mushrooms, B3 is in avocados, B6 is in bananas, and B9 is in broccoli, to name a few. Anti-oxidants keep cells healthy and ward off disease. A healthy body is a happy body. </p>

												<h2><a href="https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/intermediate-muscle-building-workout.html" target="_blank">THE 7-DAY  
													<strong>DETOX MEAL PLAN</strong>
													TO CLEAN UP YOUR DIET</a></h2>
											</header>
											<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>Clean up your diet in just one week with this easy-to-follow nutrition plan.<br>By Lori Zanini, R.D.</h3>
											<p>You can’t perform at your peak if your body is not properly fueled. And the best way to make sure you’re getting the nutrients you need is to step back and look at your overall diet habits. Use this week of meals to detox your diet and eliminate the stuff you don’t want, like added sugars and processed carbs. Then, load up on what you do need — whole foods from all the major food groups. The result: a balanced diet that will help you fuel up and fully recover. Consider this a chance to reboot your eating habits to keep your body both satisfied and energized.</p>
											<p><strong>THE DIET DETOX BASICS</strong><br>
												We’ve put together four days of menus that you can mix and match over the week. The meals are simple to prepare and have few ingredients, so they’ll fit into any crazy-busy schedule. Each meal should include a high-quality lean protein and healthy fat sources to keep hunger levels under control while fueling muscles.

												As a general rule, aim to get at least five to six servings of fruits and veggies a day, as well as foods that help detox and ensure proper digestion with probiotics and prebiotics. To make it easy, we’ve included a few recipes that will fit right into your meal prep.
												Make sure you’re staying hydrated by drinking at least 8 ounces of water at each meal and snack, and time your meals for optimal performance. Aim to work out 2 to 3 hours after eating and have a meal or snack within 30 to 60 minutes of exercise to maximize muscle-building activity.

												Follow each day’s meals as listed below or switch them around to suit your taste. By the end of the week you’ll have found a few new favorites and be on track for a cleaner diet you can easily sustain.
